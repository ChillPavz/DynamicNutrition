/**
 * The two things a Fabric or NeoForge attachment does for free and a Forge capability does not:
 * send the player's values to their own client, and carry them across a death.
 *
 * <p>Sending is deferred to the end of the player's tick rather than done inside
 * {@code markDirty}. A single tick can move several nutrients, award a meal and change the held
 * status, and each of those marks the state dirty; sending immediately would put three or four
 * identical payloads on the wire for one eaten carrot. Both other loaders coalesce for the same
 * reason, so this keeps the traffic the same shape on all three.
