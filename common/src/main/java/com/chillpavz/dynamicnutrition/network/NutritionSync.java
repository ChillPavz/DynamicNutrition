/**
 * Decides when a player's copy of the food table is out of date, and sends it.
 *
 * <p>Both loaders have a join event and neither has a usable "a datapack reload finished" one, so
 * rather than wiring two different reload hooks this watches the table's own generation counter from
 * the per-player server tick that already runs. A player who has never been sent the table, a player
 * whose table predates a {@code /reload}, and a player who has just joined all present as the same
 * mismatch and are all handled by the same three lines.
 *
 * <p><b>The map is weak on purpose.</b> A {@code ServerPlayer} is replaced on death and on a
 * dimension change, so a strong map would pin every player object the server has ever made. The
 * replacement simply reads as never having been sent the table, which resends it, which is correct.
