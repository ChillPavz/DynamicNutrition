# shared/

Files that are byte-identical in every band that uses them live here once, instead of once per
toolchain folder. A file belongs here only when it is identical in every band named by its folder;
anything that differs in even one band stays in that band's own source tree.

| Folder | Taken by |
|---|---|
| `java/`, `resources/` | every band and every loader (added by each `common/build.gradle`) |
| `loaders/<loader>/` | every band of that loader: `fabric`, `forge`, `neoforge` |
| `loaders/<a>+<b>/` | every band of both loaders: `forge+neoforge` |
| `eras/<bands>/<module>/` | only the bands named, joined by `+`; the module may name several loaders (`fabric+forge`) |
| `gradle/` | script plugins the bands apply |
| `tools/` | Python the bands' tools import |

Bands are named exactly, never by toolchain folder: `1.20.1`, `1.21.1`, `1.21.11`, `26.x`.
So `eras/1.21.1+1.21.11+26.x/common` is common code for those three bands and no other.

Code that several loaders of ONE toolchain folder share, in one band only, stays inside that folder,
as `<toolchain>/<a>+<b>/src/<era>/java` (for example `1.21/fabric+forge/src/1.21.11/java`).

## How a band picks its folders

`gradle/shared-sources.gradle` decides, and every module's `build.gradle` applies it. It reads the
band's name (`version_band`, else `minecraft_version_label`, else `minecraft_version`) and adds, as
source folders, each `loaders/` folder naming the module, each `eras/` folder naming the band, and
the toolchain's own `<a>+<b>/src/{main,<era>}` folders. `tools/band.py` mirrors the same rules, so the
build tools find a file wherever it lives.

## Moving a file here

Build every band first and keep the jars. Move the file, rebuild, and compare every shipped jar entry
for entry: nothing may be added, removed or changed.
